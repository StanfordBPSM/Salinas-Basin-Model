README - 2/21/13
Time_(paleo) files are XYZ column format, no header.
X and Y are in meters, CA State Plane IV projected coordinates, GCS NAD 1983.
Z is depth in PM meters, subsea.  Below sea leve is positive.

2-25-13.  Noticed that datapoints are missing from these files (maybe because they are Excel based).
Decided to import the .dat files in the PaleoDataPointsOnly folder in PM into Petrel.
Import these as zmaps.  Convert these to points.  Add these as well tops.
Create modeled horizons again!
