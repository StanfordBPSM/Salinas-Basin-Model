# Salinas Basin Model

Salinas Basin features at least seven oil fields containing over half a billion barrels of recoverable oil. This is a 3D model of the Salinas Basin, California. It was constructed by Dr. Tess Menoti for her dissertation to understand the effect of strike-slip tectonism on the petroleum system and the diagenesis of the Miocene Monterey Formation.

Model results exemplify potential implications for inclusion of strike-slip fault motion in basin models, such as formation of alternative migration pathways through time and mixing of petroleum from multiple sources in the same accumulation.

Salinas Basin location map. The dashed outlined box delineates the approximate extent of the sedimentary basin that serves as the study area for strike-slip basin modeling method development. Hillshade topography, major strike-slip fault traces (bold black lines, relative motion indicated with arrows), pods of active source rock at depths >2 km, productive oil fields (green polygons), and cities (black boxes) are also delineated. Salinas Basin is located in central California, U.S.A., as depicted in the inset map. HVT: Hames Valley Trough; AST: Arroyo Seco Trough.

Schematic representation of basin structure and petroleum system elements at present-day. Dextral strike-slip fault represents the Reliz-Riconada Fault. Cartoon oil derricks roughly correspond to the San Ardo, King City, and Monroe Swell fields from south to north, respectively. The cross-sectional view reveals basic basin shape defining the Hames Valley Trough pod of active source rock geometry.

Source rock isochore map. This map represents total source rock vertical thickness based on well log estimates. White area within the basin boundary represents the absence of source rock. Plus sign symbols illustrate the distribution of wells used in construction of all model horizons, including source rock depth maps.
